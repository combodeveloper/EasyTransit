            Dashboard design. Is it easy? Far from it. Great dashboard UI designs are developed daily to remind us of the unlimited possibilities we have to present data in a creative way.

Rather than getting heaped with information we can’t understand, dashboard UX designs help us understand what is really important, and open up a data wonderland where we can understand everything, interpret everything, and make use of the story it is telling us.

User dashboards are becoming increasingly important as the digital age showers us with more and more data.

They help to prevent us from drowning in that sea of data, or at least the good ones do. Great user dashboards are like windows into a data wonder land. They help users to navigate data, to interpret it, and to unravel the story the data is trying to tell us.

The best user dashboards out there organize data in a way which makes it easy to understand where information is coming for.
            Bengali evolved during 1000–1200 CE from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects such as the Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, which developed from a group of dialects that were close to Vedic and Classical Sanskrit. Literary Bengali saw borrowings from Classical Sanskrit, preserving spelling while adapting pronunciation to that of Bengali, during the period of Middle Bengali.

Bengali binds together a culturally diverse region and is an important contributor to Bengali nationalism. In former East Bengal, known today as Bangladesh, the love for the language led to the Bengali Language Movement. During this movement, on 21 February 1952, several people were killed during protests to gain its recognition as a state language and to maintain its writing in the Bengali script.

Bengali arose from eastern Middle Indo-Aryan dialects of the Indian subcontinent. Magadhi Prakrit and Pali, the earliest recorded spoken languages in the region and the language of Gautama Buddha born in Nepal, evolved into the Jain Prakrit or Ardhamagadhi in the early part of the first millennium CE. Ardhamagadhi, as with all of the Prakrits of North India, began to give way to what are called Apabhraṃśa ("Corrupted grammar") languages just before the turn of the first millennium. The local Apabhraṃśa language of the eastern subcontinent, Purvi Apabhraṃśa or Abahatta ("Meaningless Sounds"), eventually evolved into regional dialects, which in turn formed three groups: the Bihari languages, the Oriya languages, and the Assamese-Bengali languages.
Characters Set (Alphabets and Numerials):

Bengali character set is divided into 21 vowels, 36 consonants and modifiers. The vowels themselves can be divided into dependent and independent vowels. Along with consonants and vowels there are some special modifiers such as Virama, Candrabindu, Anusvara, Visarga. Furthermore, it also has its own numerals.
Text Processing:

The Independent vowels can be combined with consonants in different manners. For example, it can be joined to right, left, and also above and below. In old type-writers and non-standard Bengali encodings, the vowels that are attached to the left character are written first followed by consonant. The Unicode Standard requires typing order on the script consonant and vowel rather than other way around. This applies whether the vowel visually appears after or before the constant. For the rendering process the visual placement is handled separated. Therefore, if the Unicode encoding process is followed, no reordering of the characters is required.
